== Liquid HTML Editor

Liquid syntax highlighting for the amazing codemirror html source code editor.

== This fork

This is an altered version of the original Liquid Editor by Tobias LÃ¼tke.
I updated CodeMirror to version 3.16 and substituted his liquid code with
an HTML+Liquid mode by Henning Kiel, which I find more robust since it uses
overlay.

I removed the standalone demo but to use it, it's just as easy as setting
the mode to `liquid'.
